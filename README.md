Module 21 challenge



Overview of the analysis: The purpose of this analysis was to create a nueral network that can help select which applicant's fundings which have the best chance of success. Using binary classifiers, this project looks thruogh 34000 records and is optimized to predict whether or not the funding will be successfull. 

Results: 

Data Preprocessing

What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?

The following variables were used in the model:

What variable(s) are the features for your model?
What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
